# Londonderry YSA Blogger

Welcome to your calling as a ward technology specialist! As part of your calling, you will be managing the Londonderry YSA ward website. The ward website is a place where any ward members can go to find information about ward activities.

This is a repository of files and information that will be helpful to you in your calling as you serve to keep the website up to date with the latest announcements and information about the sacrament program. Most of the files here are backup files in case something goes wrong, you'll be able to restore the website to it's former glory.

## Weekly maintenance

As part of your calling, there are two pages of the website you'll need to keep up to date. You should update those pages after the ward council reviews the announcements and sacrament program during ward council on Sunday morning and before sacrament meeting.

You should have access to a "Londerry YSA Ward Program" Google document that the ward council manages. If you don't have access, ask a member of the bishopric for access to that document. The ward council will typically add announcements to the Google document throughout the week and then review it during ward council on Sunday.

You should also have access to the [Blogger website](https://www.blogger.com). Blogger is a blogging platform hosted by Google. If you don't have access, ask a member of the bishopric for access as an admin.

When copy/pasting information from the Google document to the Blogger editor, it is ***highly*** recommended to use `ctrl shift v` (or `cmd shift v` on MacOS) to paste into the Blogger editor. This will paste without formatting, so any formatting from the Google document will be ignored in favor of the Blogger formatting, ensuring that the website looks nice.
